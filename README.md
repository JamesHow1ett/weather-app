Hello, my name is Oleksandr Skorokhod. I'm a junior front-end developer. This is my second React project ever. So.. when I had coding this project I'm using technologies like:

 -  React to display the received data.
 -  Sass to write styles.
 -  For get data from API I'd using fetch.

My experience after all this:

 - Better understanding React components lifecycle.
 - How to deploy to firebase (yes I known it is simple, but it is first time for me).

That's all folks!
